This folder contains date for running the 'test' configuration of the sea level change scripts.
In the long-term, topog_master.nc should have values for land as well as ocean (ie: not just 0 on land) which will
be used to determine new ocean/land changes in a subsequent run. This is not being done as the test does not 
incorporate VILMA output yet and upon reflection, making this master file only makes sense for the final, new grid
which extends to 90S.
