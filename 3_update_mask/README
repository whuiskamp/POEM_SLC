This component of the dynamic land-sea mask tool identifies when and where changes to the model's land-sea mask are required.

Changes can be due to: Changes in bathymetry
					   Changes in ocean mass
					   Changes in ice sheet extent

Steps:
	Load data
	1 - load topography file from previous run (old).
	2 - load topography from updated bathy (previous step)
	3 - load MOM restart file
	4 - load file with ice sheet data (unclear what that is at this point)

	Identify if changes are required
	5 - If depth integrated h in restart file is less than 0.5m, change to land
	6 - If topog cell was previously ocean and new cell is < 10m, make land
		If topog cell was previously land and now has depth >= 10m, make ocean
		A cell may only change if it is land-adjacent.
	7 - If ice sheet covers a cell, this overrides all previous changes
