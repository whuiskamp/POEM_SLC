This script will, broadly speaking check the new bathymetry/ land sea mask for consistency, ensuring the next model run will be numerically stable. 

This includes checks for:

- isolated ocean cells and inland seas/lakes
- subgrid-scale channels that should be open/ closed at certain time periods (this is specific to LGM runs, whereas at all other times, existing channels should suffice, so long as the cells they connect do not dry out).

####### Notes #########

Tool should:
1: Use chng_mask and o_mask to identify newly isolated cells (how?)
2: Decide if these isolated cells should be filled in or remain small inland seas like the Baltic
   Criteria would include: # of cells isolated (one should be filled, 4 maybe left alone?), 
   depth of isolated cells (eg < 100m would be too shallow for such a small body of water),

The Fensoscandian Ice sheet will likely be the trickiest.

It would work to implement a square contour tracing algorithm with a Jacob's stopping criterion.

### NOTE ###

chk_cells.py is now mostly complete. One thing to go back and check is if we change a cell from ocean to land in the middle of the ocean, or add to an island.
This will likely cause the algorithm to identify the entire ocean as 'isolated' cells. Implement an extra check whereby the number of isolated cells is summed
and if this value is too large, the cell in question is ignored.
