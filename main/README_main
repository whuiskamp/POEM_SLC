The current structure of the code handles bathymetry/topography in the following way:

1) First is the default 'control' bathymetry used for the initial conditions       - topog_ctrl
2) Second is the bathymetry used in the last integration of MOM6 before coupling   - topog_old
3) Third is the new bathy that has been updated via fields from the VILMA model    - topog_new

Note that currently, only the topog_new field is used in the tool, but the ctrl and old fields are read in as well, as they may be of use
in the future (the same goes for the majority of fields in the ocean restart).

RSL fields taken from VILMA represent the change in bathymetry and mass flux and are directly applied to MOM, with the assumption that
sea level fields in MOM will roughly agree with these. Disagreements are only significant when VILMA suggests cells should be wet when they are dry 
or vice versa, but practically speaking, this is no impediment, and errors will always exist due to the regridding to the coarse ocean grid.

For the sake of simplicity, there will be a directory that handles all data for the coupling process in each experiment directory. The job script should
copy the PISM and VILMA restarts here at each coupling time-step and always with a consistent name. Currently these are named:
rsl.nc 		- VILMA restart
pism_res.nc - PISM restart
