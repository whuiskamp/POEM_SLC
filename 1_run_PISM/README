The current structure of the code handles bathymetry/topography in the following way:

1) First is the default 'control' bathymetry used for the initial conditions       - topog_ctrl
2) Second is the bathymetry used in the last integration of MOM6 before coupling   - topog_old
3) Third is the new bathy that has been updated via fields from the VILMA model    - topog_new
