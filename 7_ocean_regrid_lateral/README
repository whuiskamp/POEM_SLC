This part of the process will laterally re-distribute mass and tracers based on changes in the ocean's bathymetry and 
volume.

Input data required:
Old land-sea mask
New land-sea mask
MOM6 restart
SIS2 restart
Static grid information (area)

1 - Generate a difference mask, with 1 = new ocean and 0 = new land.
2 - If cells are not land-adjacent, 
2 - Create array of cells with appropriate vars and values 1,0 if wetting or drying. This is calculated from restart files and cellarea.


First test should simply be reducing topog by 10cm every 10 years while simultaneously sucking out sea water at different rates.
