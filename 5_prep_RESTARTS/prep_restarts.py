# This script updates restart files with new variables that have been generated 
# in previous scripts. In addition, secondary fields that need to be altered
# based on redistribution of values/ changes in the land sea mask are also 
# altered here before being saved to appropriate restarts.

# Load new restart files

# Change all ocean/ ice fields that need to be changed

# Save new fields to netCDF

# Write appropriate diagnostics to restart's metadata
